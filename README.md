4. Addition of JavaScript functions: 
    * I made use of the DOM to maniplate my page:
    - First using querySelector i picked the class of the element i wanted to manipulate and assigned variables to them using const keyword
    - there after i created a function to alert the users onclicking the "create button" that they must input a task before the creating a task
    * also i used the DOM to add elements to my page(span)
